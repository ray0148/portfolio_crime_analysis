# Crime Analysis Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 1000 crime records from 2020 to 2025 across multiple U.S. cities. The analysis focuses on crime types, geographic distribution, temporal trends, victim demographics, and crime hotspots, visualized using Power BI, Plotly, and Excel.

## Key Findings
- **Crime Types**: Vandalism is the most prevalent crime, accounting for 145 incidents.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Los Angeles and Chicago are the top crime hotspots, with 144 and 134 incidents, respectively.
- **Temporal Trends**: Crime rates peaked in 2020 with 190 incidents.
- **Victim Demographics**: Vandalism victims have a median age of around 52, suggesting targeted victimization.
- **Hotspots**: The top hotspot is Chicago, 1031 Oak St with 1 incidents.
