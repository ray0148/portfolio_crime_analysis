# Crime Analysis Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 10 crime records from 2020 to 2025 across multiple U.S. cities. The analysis focuses on crime types, geographic distribution, temporal trends, victim demographics, and crime hotspots, visualized using interactive Plotly charts.

## Key Findings
- **Crime Types**: Homicide is the most prevalent crime, accounting for 2 incidents.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Philadelphia and San Antonio are the top crime hotspots, with 3 and 2 incidents, respectively.
- **Temporal Trends**: Crime rates peaked in 2024 with 4 incidents.
- **Victim Demographics**: Vandalism victims have a median age of around 36, suggesting targeted victimization.
- **Hotspots**: The top hotspot is Chicago, 635 Oak St with 1 incidents.

## Visualizations
1. **Crime Type Distribution**: Bar chart showing the frequency of each crime type.
2. **Crimes by City**: Bar chart of the top 10 cities by crime count.
3. **Crime Trends by Year**: Line chart tracking crime counts from 2020 to 2025.
4. **Victim Age by Crime Type**: Box plot showing age distributions for each crime type.
5. **Crime Hotspots**: Bar chart of the top 10 locations by crime count.

## Technical Details
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Plotly
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized dates, and converted ages to numeric.
- **Output**: Interactive HTML charts saved in `portfolio_crime_analysis` for portfolio inclusion.

## Next Steps
- Integrate machine learning models to predict crime probabilities.
- Enhance visualizations with real-time data updates.
- Deploy as a web dashboard using Flask and React.
